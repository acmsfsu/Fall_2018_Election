ACM Election to determine next semester's President 


# Platforms

## Huy Nguyen

I am interested in changing the culture of the ACM club. I want our club to be more beneficial to Computer Science Majors at San Francisco State. 

The ways I plan on doing this is making it mandatory for ACM members to participate in activities that will benefit this club and themselves. 

These activities will include mock interview questions via online (http://coderpad.io/) or in person white board. Another option would be to produce a side project that is hopefully developed enough to show case in front of the ACM club toward the end each semester. 

I feel that doing these things will benefit the students along with benefiting the ACM reputation along with having guest speakers sprinkled throughout the semester.

My platform is focused on building on the momentum that ACM developed under the leadership of Paul Klein last year.  If elected president, I promise to achieve the following deliverables in Spring 2018 prior to my graduation:

- Overseeing the careful planning and execution of ACM events
- Encouraging, challenging, and fostering relationships with lower-division CS majors, who will become the future student leaders of our program
- Building a focused and able team of officers who will assist me in carrying out ACM functions related to finances, activities, student support, and outreach
- Holding the ACM community and the CS department to a high academic standard while providing impartial advice and guidance

I will also find a small group of ACM members who I can introduce to the ropes during my presidency, on whom I will impart the same values that Paul Klein and Andrew Patterson have imparted on me – the importance of hard work, integrity, networking, accountability and credit, and striving for excellence in all aspects of life as a hopeful or current computer science professional – so that the legacy previous leaders left in place will survive well into the future of our department.  When I graduate, it is my hope that one of these group members will be eager to receive the torch, and I will promise them access to me for advice in the years to come in the same way that I believe my mentors will be available to me this Spring.

My qualifications include previous ACM leadership experience as a treasurer (Fall 2017) during which I consistently upheld the responsibilities of my position, a year long term as secretary of the Science and Engineering club at Foothill College, a two year long record of serving the Associated Students of Foothill College (ASFC) as Activities Coordinator, and a one year long term served with that same body as a Senator (special project position) for which I was elected by the entire student body at my college.  I was acknowledged for my service with lifetime membership in 2016.  I have unique connections to SFSU CS faculty, past ACM leadership, and off-campus professionals, whose expertise I will consult to take full advantage of the presidency.  I keep my promises, I am communicative, I am accessible, I take responsibility, and I roll up my sleeves when the going gets tough.  There are many in our community who will vouch for these qualities.

I feel sufficiently employed and networked, and I do not need this position as a bullet point on my resume.  My reason for running is solely to exercise my experience in extending ACM’s tradition of excellence before I leave.  I’m available to answer questions and concerns.
